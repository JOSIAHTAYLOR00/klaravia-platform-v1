When I first started exploring solar, one of the big questions that kept coming up was whether solar really boosts your home's resale value in an impactful way. I had heard plenty of stories about homeowners selling their properties for more because of their solar systems, but I wanted to dig a little deeper to figure out if that claim really holds water. After all, if you're going to make the investment in solar, it's important to know how it could affect your home's future value, right?

So, I took a closer look at the research, talked to a few real estate agents, and got in touch with a couple of my buddies who have already made the switch to solar for their homes. Here's what I found, and why solar could be a smart move when you consider the long-term value of your home.

## So, does Solar Really Increase Home Value?

The short answer is yes, solar panels almost always do increase your home's value. But, like most things, the exact positive impact depends on a few factors. A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that homes with rooftop solar systems sell for an average of $15,000 more than comparable homes without solar. That's a pretty significant return, especially if you're already benefiting from lower utility bills and energy independence in the meantime.

But, the increase in home value isn't just a flat number across the board. It's influenced by factors like the size of your system, how much it reduces energy costs, and even where you live. In areas with higher electricity prices, homes with solar panels tend to be even more valuable because buyers know they'll be saving more on energy bills. Multiple real estate agents proclaimed that in today's competitive housing market, solar tends to stand out as a huge selling point.

## Why Buyers Love Homes with Solar

There's a lot to love about homes with solar panels, and it's not just about lower electricity bills, though that's definitely a big part of it. When I interviewed real estate agents, they mentioned several reasons why buyers are increasingly drawn to homes with solar. Below are the three most common factors that agents identified as to why their clients are asking for homes with solar.

### 1. Financial Savings

It's no surprise that financial savings is at the top of the list. When buyers see a home with solar panels, they immediately start thinking about how much they'll save on their electricity bills. With utility prices continuing to rise at an even higher pace than inflation on average, the idea of moving into a home with little-to-no energy costs is incredibly appealing. One agent even said many of their buyers have been more willing to pay above asking for a home with solar, knowing that they'll recoup those costs over time.

### 2. Energy Independence

Solar panels also provide homeowners with a sense of energy independence. In areas where power outages are common, or where electricity prices fluctuate frequently, solar panels offer a reliable alternative. In addition, the aging grid is becoming less and less efficient, thus increasing the likelihood of more power outages each year. The idea of generating their own electricity, rather than relying on the grid, is a huge selling point for many buyers. Homes that have paired their solar panels with a battery are even more valuable and highly sought after, as those homes have accomplished true energy independence by creating their own microgrid and taking control of their home's power future.

### 3. Environmental Impact

Agents also identified that they are seeing more and more buyers who care about reducing their carbon footprint and helping the planet. Homes with solar panels are a tangible way for buyers to live more sustainably, and that's becoming a bigger priority, especially for younger, eco-conscious buyers. In fact, one agent I spoke with said that some buyers are actively requesting to see homes with not only solar but other green features as well, which is a trend they expect to keep growing.

## A Real Life Example

To understand these truths even more, I reached out to a friend who recently sold their home that had solar. The McCarthy's, who lived in a suburban neighborhood, had installed a solar system about four years ago. Their primary motivation at the time of install was to save on their energy bills. But when they decided to sell their home earlier this year, they discovered that their investment in solar paid off in a big way they didn't even factor in when they decided to go solar.

"I'm confident that our solar was a major factor in our home selling so quickly, and for more than we expected," Mr. McCarthy told me. "The buyers loved the idea of moving into a home where they wouldn't have to worry about high energy bills and were excited to take a big step in helping the environment."

The McCarthy family's experience mirrors what I found in much of my research: buyers today are not only interested in saving money on utilities, but they're also attracted to the idea of energy independence and sustainability. Having solar panels already installed can make a home much more appealing to budget and eco-conscious buyers.

## Things to Keep in Mind

Of course, not every solar installation is going to automatically add value to your home. As with anything in real estate, it's important to be strategic about your decision. From my research, here are a few things to consider if you're thinking about installing solar panels and are curious about how they'll impact your home's resale value:

### 1. The Age of Your Panels

Solar panels typically last about 25 to 30 years, and buyers are going to want to know how much life is left in them when you're selling. If your panels are fairly new, they're likely to add more value than panels that are nearing the end of their lifespan. It's something to keep in mind if you're thinking about selling in the near future. The closer you get to the end of the solar system's life, the more of a headache and expense people start picturing when they think about replacing them.

### 2. Your Local Market

Not every area is equally solar-friendly. In states where electricity costs are high, homes with solar tend to sell for significantly more. However, in regions where energy costs are low or where sunshine isn't as abundant, the increase in home value might be smaller. It's always a good idea to talk to a local real estate agent who can give you a sense of how much solar could impact your home's value in your specific area.

### 3. Aesthetic Concerns

Some buyers are hesitant about how solar panels might look on their home, though this is becoming less of an issue as solar technology advances and panels become more streamlined. If curb appeal is important in your market, it might be worth considering a more discreet installation or even ground-mounted panels if your agent suggests that other homes in the area have been affected by the aesthetics of solar.

## Well, Is Solar Worth It for Resale Value?

If you're thinking about solar panels as an investment for your home, there's a good chance they'll increase your home's resale value, especially if you're in a solar-friendly market with high energy costs. Homes with solar aren't just attractive to buyers for their environmental benefits, they also offer financial savings, energy independence, and even potential carryover tax incentives, all of which can make your home stand out in a competitive market.

And while solar panels do have an upfront cost, the long-term savings and the potential boost to your home's value make them a smart investment for many homeowners. Whether you're planning to stay in your home for years or considering selling in the near future, solar energy could be the key to keeping more money in your wallet and unlocking additional value in your property.
