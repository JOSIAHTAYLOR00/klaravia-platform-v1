One of the first questions I had when I started learning about solar panels was, "How well do they hold up in bad weather?" I mean, we all know that the sun doesn't always shine through through the clouds, and some areas get hit with pretty intense storms and elements. If you're going to invest in solar, you want to be sure that your panels will survive and keep working no matter what Mother Nature throws at them.

It turns out, solar panels are far tougher than you would initially think. They are built to withstand everything from heavy snow to high winds, hailstorms, snow, and even extreme heat. Let's take a closer look at how solar panels perform in different types of weather and whether they're worth the investment, even in areas prone to harsh conditions.

## Built to Last: How Panels Handle the Elements

Upon research, the first of many things I discovered is that solar panels are incredibly durable. They are designed and tested to withstand a variety of weather conditions, which is why you see them installed everywhere from snowy mountain towns to hurricane-heavy beach sides to sun-drenched deserts. Solar manufacturers know that these panels are going to be exposed to the elements 24/7 for many years, so they put them through rigorous testing to ensure they can hold up.

Most solar panels are built with tempered glass that is strong enough to handle impacts and weather events. They're also designed to resist water damage, with layers of protective material that keep the cells inside safe from moisture. In addition, the fact that many solar panels come with warranties that last 25 years or more tells you just how confident manufacturers are in their durability.

Ok, so having protection through warranties is one thing, but no one wants to constantly deal with claims on their equipment and the headache of constantly replacing panels on their home. Let's take a deeper look at durability and how solar panels perform through different weather conditions.

## Heavy Rain and Storms: No Problem

If you're worried about rain, I've got good news: solar panels are waterproof. The panels are sealed tightly to prevent any water from getting inside and damaging the solar cells. In fact, heavy rain can actually be beneficial for your panels, as it often helps wash away dirt and debris, keeping them clean and operating efficiently.

During thunderstorms, your panels are built to handle high winds as well. Most solar panels are tested to withstand winds up to 140 miles per hour, which is equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. So unless you're in a truly extreme weather zone, like where harsh hurricanes or tornadoes are very common, you shouldn't have to worry about your panels being damaged by high winds.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that proper installation is key here. Your solar panels need to be securely mounted to your roof or structure to handle strong winds, and working with a professional installer ensures that they're built to last through whatever storms come your way. This is why it is important to make sure you partner with a company like Klaravia, who not only provides you with options for your installer, but also vets each installer for quality. Through the platform, you gain instant access to in-depth looks at each installer's equipment offerings, reviews, warranties, and more.

## Hailstorms: Surprisingly Resilient

Living in the Midwest, I've heard this question a lot: "What about hail? Won't it crack the panels?" It's a reasonable concern, especially if you live in a region where hailstorms are common like I do. But again, the manufacturers have thought of this, and the technology behind the equipment has gotten increasingly more resilient. Solar panels are built with tempered glass, which is much stronger than the glass you'd find in your windows.

In fact, solar panels are tested to withstand hailstones as large as 1 inch in diameter falling at 50 miles per hour, which is pretty intense! So, while no material is completely immune to damage, the odds of hail breaking your solar panels are low. And, if anything does happen, it's important to choose panels from installers that provide warranties that cover damage from severe weather events like hail.

## Snow and Ice: No Big Deal

Now, if you live in a colder climate, you might be wondering how snow and ice impact solar panels. Surprisingly, solar panels actually work better in cooler temperatures than in extreme heat. Cold weather itself isn't a problem. In fact, some of the sunniest, coldest places like Colorado and Germany are leaders in solar energy production.

As for snow, most solar panels are installed at an angle, which helps snow slide off relatively easily. When the sun comes out, the panels heat up enough to melt any remaining snow or ice. And even if snow is covering your panels for a few days, it's not a huge deal. Eventually, the snow will melt, and your panels will go back to producing energy. In the meantime, they are built to handle the weight of snow without cracking or sagging. Solar panels are tested to support up to 5,400 "pascals", which is roughly equivalent to more than 100 pounds of snow per square meter.

If you live in an area that gets a lot of snow, you can always add a snow guard or snow rake to keep your panels clear during heavy snowfalls, but for the most part, they are designed to handle winter weather just fine.

## Extreme Heat: No Sweat

While it might seem counterintuitive, extreme heat can actually make solar panels a little less efficient. Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity, but when they get too hot, they can lose some of their efficiency - usually around 10-25%. However, this doesn't mean solar panels are worthless or even necessarily ineffective in hot climates.

Manufacturers design solar panels to withstand high temperatures, and they're tested in temperatures as high as 185Â°F. So, even in the hottest parts of the country, like Arizona or Texas, your panels will still generate plenty of electricity, they might just be a bit less efficient on the hottest days of the year.

If you live in a very hot area, you can talk to your installer about getting panels that are optimized for heat resistance, or installing your panels in a way that allows air to flow underneath them to help with cooling. Installers in the hottest regions know to expect many 100 degree plus days, and they have learned to provide equipment and installation techniques designed to counteract the effects.

## Should We Be Concerned About Lightning?

This was something I hadn't even thought of at first, but a quick search on Reddit suggested it's a question many are asking: "What happens if lightning strikes my solar panels?" The good news is that lightning itself isn't typically a direct threat to solar panels. While no system is completely immune to a direct strike, solar panels are grounded, just like the rest of your electrical system, which helps dissipate the energy from a lightning strike and keeps your system safe.

If you live in an area with frequent lightning, you can also ask your installer about additional grounding options or surge protectors for your solar system, which can add an extra layer of protection.

## Well, Is Solar Worth the Investment in Harsh Weather Environments?

After digging into all of this, I can confidently say that solar panels are absolutely worth the investment, even if you live in an area with harsh weather. These panels are expertly designed and tested to handle everything from snow to hail to extreme heat and high winds. And, with most systems backed by long-term warranties, you're protected against the unexpected.

The key takeaway here is that solar panels are built to last. The technology has come a long way, and manufacturers know that these panels will be exposed to the elements every day for decades. Whether you're in a hot, sunny climate or somewhere with long, snowy winters, solar is a smart investment.

If you're still on the fence, I'd recommend talking to one of Klaravia's solar experts who can speak to the specifics of your area's weather conditions. They can walk you through the details and help you figure out the best system for your home and the optimal installer partner to place it on your roof.
