Are you considering making the switch to solar energy for your home? If so, you're not alone. With the rising cost of traditional energy sources and growing concerns about environmental sustainability, many homeowners are turning to solar power as a clean, renewable alternative. But before you take the leap into solar energy, it's natural to have questions. That's why we've put together the top 10 questions about residential solar roofs and provided answers to help shed some light on this eco-friendly solution.

## 1. How do solar panels work?

Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, harness sunlight and convert it into electricity through a process called the "photovoltaic effect". When sunlight hits the solar panels, the photons in the sunlight are absorbed by the solar cells, creating an electric current. An **inverter** takes this direct current electricity and converts it into an alternating current, allowing it to be usable for powering homes. The panels continuously generate electricity as long as they are exposed to sunlight, providing a clean, sustainable, and renewable energy source without relying on your utility company.

## 2. Do solar panels work in rainy or cloudy weather?

A common misconception is that solar roofs won't generate power if there is limited sunlight. While solar panels work best in direct sunlight, they can still generate electricity on cold, cloudy, and even rainy or snowy days. Solar panels are designed to capture both direct and indirect sunlight, so even on overcast days, they can still produce electricity, albeit at a lower efficiency. It's estimated that solar roof systems generate about 20% of their normal power output when sunlight isn't piercing through the clouds.

## 3. How much do solar panels cost?

The cost of a solar roof can vary depending on factors like the size of the system, the quality of the panels, and installation costs. On average, homeowners can expect to pay anywhere from $17,000 to $24,000 for a solar panel system according to a study by the Architectural Digest. However, there are often incentives and financing options available to help offset these costs, so it's important to understand what resources are available to you. It is also important to compare and contrast several options before deciding which company installs your solar to ensure you're getting the best combination of quality and price available in your area.

## 4. Are there incentives available for installing solar panels?

Yes, there are several incentives available to homeowners who install solar panels, including the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), state and local rebates, and net metering programs. Currently, the Federal ITC provides homeowners with a 30% tax credit on all eligible costs of installation. State and local incentives vary based on where you live.

## 5. How much can I save with solar panels?

The amount of money you can save with solar panels depends on your energy usage, the size of your solar system, and the cost of electricity in your area. On average, homeowners can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on their energy bills by switching to solar power. However, adding a solar roof to your home isn't free, as we mentioned above. To calculate your total lifetime savings, it's important to consider the cost of installing and financing solar plus maintenance against your monthly energy bill savings plus the increase in your home value resulting from your renewable energy roof.

## 6. How long do solar panels last?

Most solar panels come with a warranty of 25 years, but they can last much longer with proper maintenance. Constructed with hardy materials such as tempered glass, aluminum frames, and silicon solar cells, solar panels are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions like rain, snow, hail, and high winds. Many solar panels continue to produce electricity for 30 years or more, making them a reliable long-term investment in energy savings.

## 7. What happens if my solar panels produce more electricity than I use?

If your solar panels produce more electricity than you use, the excess energy is typically fed back into the grid through a process called net metering. In some cases, homeowners can receive credits for the excess energy they produce, which can offset future electricity bills. Additionally, homeowners who pair their solar roof with a battery storage system have excess solar production sent to charge the battery. Once it is fully charged, the excess production is sent back through the net metering process again. Some states and utilities set limits on net metering, so check with your localities to learn more.

## 8. Do I need to replace my roof before installing solar panels?

It's not always necessary to replace your roof before installing solar panels, but it's something you should consider. If your roof is old or in poor condition, it may be a good idea to replace it before installing solar panels to avoid any potential issues down the road.

## 9. What maintenance is required for solar panels?

Solar panels require minimal maintenance, typically just occasional cleaning to remove dirt and debris. Most solar panel systems come with warranties that cover any necessary repairs or replacements, so homeowners can enjoy worry-free energy production for years to come.

## 10. Can I install solar panels myself?

While it is technically possible to install solar panels yourself, it's not recommended unless you have experience and expertise in electrical work and roofing. It's best to hire a professional solar installer who can ensure that your system is installed safely and correctly. Using a qualified solar installation company with good reviews and competitive pricing can ensure your rooftop solar is ready to produce efficient energy and withstand weather obstacles year-round.
