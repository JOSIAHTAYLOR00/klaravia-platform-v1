Within the green initiative, rooftop solar power stands as a beacon of hope for a brighter, cleaner future for planet Earth and its inhabitants. Yet, despite undeniable benefits, solar energy is often plagued by myths and misconceptions that cloud many homeowners' understanding of its true potential. Here, we will shed light on five of the most common solar myths and unveil the underlying facts, empowering you to make informed decisions about embracing solar with confidence.

## Myth: Solar panels only produce energy in sunny climates

**Fact:** While it is true that solar panels thrive most on bright, sunny days, they still generate power in cloudy, rainy, snowy, and cooler climates. Solar technology has advanced to the point where panels can efficiently convert minimal sunlight into usable energy, making them a viable option even in regions where poor weather conditions are common. Usually, panels run around 15-25% of their normal energy output on days with heavy overcast. If you run into an extended period without sunlight, harnessing the power of net metering and solar batteries can allow you to use energy credits that were stored up during periods of sunlight to help offset your needs.

## Myth: Solar is too expensive for most homeowners

**Fact:** While there are significant costs associated with putting solar panels on your roof, it's important to view them as a long-term investment rather than merely a short-term expense. Some homeowners might be able to reduce their energy bills lower than their monthly payments on their solar loan. Others find value in creating their own energy grid rather than relying on the overextended grid that their utility company uses. Many find that the value of their home is increased by nearly as much as the cost of the panels, increasing curb appeal and buyer interest when they go to sell in the future. With competition creating declining installation costs, generous government incentives, and quality financing options, solar energy has become increasingly accessible to homeowners of all income levels.

## Myth: Solar panels require frequent maintenance and are prone to damage and failure

**Fact:** On the contrary, solar panels are remarkably durable and often require minimal maintenance over their lifespan. With no moving parts to wear out, solar panels can withstand harsh weather conditions and continue to produce electricity reliably for decades. Routine inspections and occasional cleaning are typically all that's needed to ensure optimal performance. It's more common that the roof underneath the solar panels would go bad before the actual panels do, as the panels are made of durable, weatherproof, high-quality material and last between 20-40 years on average, according to the SEIA.

## Myth: Rooftop solar makes your home unattractive

**Fact:** Solar roof systems have become increasingly sleek and aesthetically appealing over the years as technology advances and more options become available to homeowners. Solar can now not only enhance the visual appeal of a property but also increase its value! Studies have shown that solar-equipped properties command higher resale values and sell faster than non-solar properties. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, a solar roof is generally accepted as an upgrade to curb appeal on several fronts these days.

## Myth: Small solar roofs don't have a significant environmental impact

**Fact:** While it is true that larger projects have a greater impact on the green initiative, it is completely untrue to say small, residential rooftop solar doesn't play a meaningful part. The average residential solar installation is 7.2kW and eliminates around 2.9 tons of carbon emissions annually, roughly equivalent to planting around 75 trees every single year. As homeowners around the country adopt solar, that number grows substantially and makes a huge, lasting impact on the planet. Also, solar roofs, equipped with energy storage systems like batteries, have the ability to create their own microgrids, which are small-scale, self-contained electrical networks. By generating and storing electricity locally, these microgrids can operate independently from the larger grid during periods of high demand or grid instability. This reduces the strain on the main grid, as homes with solar roofs can draw power from their own stored energy rather than relying solely on the overextended grid. This contributes to a more resilient and flexible energy system, reducing the risk of blackouts and failures while promoting greater energy independence and sustainability.

These are five of the most common myths we hear on a regular basis among many others. We hope to have shed some light on these by uncovering the facts about solar energy. Ultimately, our goal is to pave the way for a more informed and sustainable future for homeowners and, ultimately, the planet we call home.
